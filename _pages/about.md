# Welcome!

👋 Hi, I'm **Aoyu Pang (庞奥宇)**, a Ph.D. student in the **School of Data Science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)**.  
My research focuses on **Reinforcement Learning**, **Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)**, and **Urban Air Mobility (UAM)**.  
I aim to develop intelligent decision-making frameworks that integrate **autonomous vehicles**, **air taxis**, and **traffic signal control** for future smart cities.
